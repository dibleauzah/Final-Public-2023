Progress Notes; SEP 24:


>> Details: 
	>>> I ran into a problem yesterday with VS-Code, while attempting to import the pandas library. So today, I've tried solving the issue, with help from one of my Code for Philly/PHLASK buddies. Part of the problem was: I didn't have a virtual environment installed in my relevant working directory.
	>>> We thus had to install that, along with a ".gitignore" file in the same directory. 
	>>> That action then enabled the proper/current version of Python to be activated in the directory.
	>>> However, I still haven't solved the Pandas issue yet. And ideally, I would love to install all the libraries I'll have to work with for Python. But that's a fight for another day, I guess! [**Shrugging Emoji**]
	\\==========\\
	>>> I also listed the seven problems I'll be tackling for the algorithm task.


//----------x----------//
Progress Notes; OCT 4:

>> Goal(s) for today: continue re-acclimating to regular close examination and processing of code-blocks.
	>>> This can be achieved continuously with the algos.
	>>> But I also need to ensure that I continue substantively with the full-stack, front-end, and back-end app-practicing.

>> Specific goal for today; Oct 4. 1 algo for Python. Important side-note: apparently, the Python issue--vis-a-vis importing the "Pandas" library (which is more-than-likely a mere symptom of a larger issue)--is not fixed yet.

>> But for now, I'm just going to ignore that.

	>>> Related interesting development: apparently, the "import 'math'" instruction seems to work well in the algorithms sub-directory. And when I tested the statement "import Pandas" in the same file in which the "import 'math'" statement worked, the same problem occurred; i.e., the squiggly line appeared under 'Pandas' with VS-Code helpfully giving me some suggestions, re: how to solve the issue.
	>>> (^^) Trouble-shooting: T.-B.-Continued!
