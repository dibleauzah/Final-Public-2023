//?_"Min, Max, and Avg."
//?_Given an array, print the max, min and average values for that array.
//*_1)--Open-Book--It's Ok to Look Before Testing the Code.
//*_2)--I__Testing suspended (for today.) See farther below for additional related comment.

// let myArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// var min = myArr[0];
// var max = myArr[0];
// var avg = 0;

// for (let i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++){
//     if (myArr[i] < min) min = myArr[i];
//     if (myArr[i] > max) max = myArr[i];
//     avg += myArr[i];
// }
// avg /= myArr.length;

// console.log("Min is : " + min);
// console.log("Max is : " + max);
// console.log("Average is " + avg);

//*_2)--II__I am not sure--in fact, I really doubt (with my assigned odds against =  67%), that this code-block is going to run successfully. Regardless, I'm sticking to my plan as declared above, re: not testing it. Goal of not testint the code: to help ease mysele back into the habit of regular codin, versus coding "well".
