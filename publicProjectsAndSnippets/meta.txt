Progress Notes:

	>>> I ran into a problem yesterday with VS-Code, while attempting to import the pandas library. So today, I've tried solving the issue, with help from one of my Code for Philly/PHLASK buddies. Part of the problem was: I didn't have a virtual environment installed in my relevant working directory.
	>>> We thus had to install that, along with a ".gitignore" file in the same directory. 
	>>> That action then enabled the proper/current version of Python to be activated in the directory.
	>>> However, I still haven't solved the Pandas issue yet. And ideally, I would love to install all the libraries I'll have to work with for Python. But that's a fight for another day, I guess! [**Shrugging Emoji**]

	>>> I also listed the seven problems I'll be tackling for the algorithm task.
